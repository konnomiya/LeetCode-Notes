# Reverse Linked List
## Link
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

## Solution 1 - Iterative
### Intuition
Need to use two pointers, *prev* and *cur* to track the previous node and current node in order to change the next pointer to the previous node.
Key steps:
1. Store the next element of current node
2. Change the next pointer to the current node to point to previous node
3. Move *prev* pointer to point to current node
4. Move *cur* pointer to point to the next element at first step
5. At the end, the *prev* pointer ends at the last node, which is the new head of the reversed linked list, and *cur* points to None

### Code
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev, cur = None, head
        while cur:
            cur.next, prev, cur = prev, cur, cur.next
        return prev
        

```
### Complexity
T = O(N), S = O(1), Where N is the length of the linked list

## Solution 2 - Recursive
### Intuition
An important point is, what's the **definition** of your recursion function?  
**Definition:** Input a head node, reverse the linked list starting from this head node, then return the new head node.  

Let say we have a linked list (length N), and we already reversed (n-1) node, what should we do next?  
We want this reversed linked list point to the original head node:  
**head.next.next = head**  
and the head node should point to null at the end.

### Code
```
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        last = self.reverseList(head.next)
        head.next.next = head
        head.next = None
        return last
```

### Complexity
T = O(N), S = O(N)
